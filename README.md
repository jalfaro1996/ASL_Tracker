# ASL_Tracker
"""
This project is still under development
"""

This is a project that will track hand movement of the user and allow the user to use the ASL (American Sign Language) alphabet to spell out words.  

This project is using the openCV-python and mediapipe library to follow the users hand movement, and to control the users camera while in use.

Once complete, this project should allow users to sign the ASL alphabet and the program will reconize, and write down what letters the user is signing.

In real world, this can be used for companies that do not have an ASL interpreter to communicate with a broader horizon of clients.
